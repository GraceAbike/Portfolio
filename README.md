[Live Demo link]( https://graceabike.github.io/Portfolio/)
## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
- Create a new GitHub repo.
- Create a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
- Add a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file to your project - please use this template but remember to customize it to your project.
A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header .
- Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
- Open a pull request.


### Install
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
- Open terminal
- Clone this project by the command.

### prerequisites
- You should implement the following interactions:
- 
- When the user clicks (or taps) the button to check project details, the popup with details about the project appears.
- When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the popup disappears.
- In order to associate each project with the popup window details, you must refactor the project section:
- 
- You need to use a JavaScript array to store all of the information for all projects.
- For each project you need to store the following pieces of data in a JavaScript object, at a minimum: name, description, featured image, technologies, link to live version, link to source.
- You need to update the main page so that the projects section is created dynamically using the information stored in that JavaScript object. Remember, all of the HTML in that section is created when the page loads.
After that, you could implement the popup window.
### usege
- For anyone who wants to practice html5 or/and css3
- For anyone who wants to create his own portfolio.
