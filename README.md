To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
- Create a new GitHub repo.
- Create a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
- Add a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file to your project - please use this template but remember to customize it to your project.
A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header .
- Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
- Open a pull request.


### Install

### prerequisites
- Check all of the items listed in the article Easy Checks ‚Äì A First Review of Web Accessibility (which you already read in the previous lesson).
- Determine if the Portfolio needs any changes.
- Make changes in a separate branch and open a new pull request.
- Prepare a report listing all points that you have checked, and the result of your evaluation.
- the report should include:
- List all points that you have checked, i.e:
- Page titles
- Image text alternatives** (<img alt="alt text">)
- Text headings
- Color contrast
- Resize
- Interaction (labels are optional but recommended as voiceover tools can read them, and should be set as invisible to match the Figma design)
- Moving content
- Multimedia
- The basic structure of the page
- Each point on the list needs to include the result of your evaluation:
- If everything was ok, make a statement about that (e.g. "Page titles - no issues found").
- If you needed to change something, link to the corresponding line of code in your pull request changes.
- Add your report to the description of your pull request.
